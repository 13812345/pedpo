          <p class="font-base mt-4">Please read these Terms of Service (“Terms”) carefully as they contain important information about your legal rights, remedies and obligations. By accessing or using Pedpo Platform, you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms. In this agreement, Pedpo Legal entity will be referred to as Pedpo Inc., Pedpo.com, Pedpo.ca, us, Pedpo Inc, Pedpo, … </p>
          <p class="text-xs text-gray-700 leading-5 pt-3 md:text-sm md:leading-6 break-all">
            These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement ("Agreement") between you and Pedpo (as defined below) governing your access to and use of the Pedpo website, including any subdomains thereof, and any other websites through which Pedpo makes its services available (collectively, "Site"), our online application, our mobile, tablet and other smart device applications, and application program interfaces (collectively, "Application") and all associated services (collectively, "Pedpo Services" , "Pedpo Market" ). The Site, Application and Pedpo Services together are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Pedpo Platform”. Our policies applicable to your use of the Pedpo Platform are incorporated by reference into this Agreement.

            When these Terms mention “Pedpo,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” it refers to the Pedpo company you are contracting with. Your contracting entity will generally be determined based on your country of residence or establishment. 
          </p>
          <p class="font-lg mt-4">	If your country of residence or establishment is CANADA, you are contracting with Pedpo, Inc., 5576 Yonge Street, P.O Box 10048, Toronto, ON M2N 5S0, CANADA. </p>

          <p class="text-xs text-gray-700 leading-5 pt-3 md:text-sm md:leading-6 break-all">
            Any and all payment processing services through or in connection with your use of the Pedpo Platform is solely the user’s responsibility. All items and services provided by Pedpo at this point of time is free of charge, and Pedpo is relieved from any responsibility in exchanging money, monetary purposes between users of these services. Users need to proceed with caution and be vigilant towards any fraudulent items, or transactions. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Users and service providers alone are responsible for identifying, understanding, and complying with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to their Listings and Services (as defined below). For example, some cities have laws that restrict their ability to provide services. In many cities, Service providers, Trades, skilled professionals, are required to get a permit or obtain a license before providing certain Services (such as dealing with electricity matters, plumbing, treating animals or operating a vehicle). Users and service providers are alone responsible for identifying and obtaining any required licenses, permits, or registrations for any Services they offer. Certain types of Services may be prohibited altogether. Penalties may include fines or other enforcement. If you have questions about how local laws apply to your Listing(s) and Service(s) on Pedpo, you should always seek legal guidance. 
          </p>
          <h3 class="font-semibold text-base md:xl mt-8"> Scope of Pedpo Services</h3>
          <p class="text-xs text-gray-700 leading-5 pt-3 md:text-sm md:leading-6 break-all">
            The Pedpo Platform is an online marketplace that enables registered users (“Members”) and certain third parties who offer services (Members and third parties who offer services are “Professional skilled trades” and the services they offer are “Services”) to publish such varied Services on the Pedpo Platform (“Listings”, “Market”, “Services”,) and to communicate and transact directly with Members that are seeking to buy, rent or book such Services or items (Members using Services are “Buyers”, “Sellers”, “Lessee”, “Lessor”). Services may include the offering of selling their properties, or belongings ("Market"), Renting an item/s in various categories (“Market”), Providing particular services (“Services”), and a variety of other items or related services. 
            <br><br>
            As the provider of the Pedpo Platform, Pedpo does not own, create, sell, rent, resell, provide, control, manage, offer, deliver, or supply any Listings or Services, nor is Pedpo an organiser or retailer of packages. Users and service providers alone are responsible for their Listings and Services. When Members create, make or accept a listing, they are entering into a contract directly with each other. Pedpo is not and does not become a party to or other participant in any contractual relationship between Members, nor is Pedpo a real estate broker or insurer. Pedpo is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any of the members, member, services, professional workers/trades or parties. 
        <br> <br>
        While we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes, Pedpo has no control over and does not guarantee (i) the existence, quality, safety, suitability, or legality of any Listings, items or Services, (ii) the truth or accuracy of any Listing descriptions, Ratings, Reviews, or other Member Content (as defined below), or (iii) the performance or conduct of any Member or third party. Pedpo does not endorse any Member, Listing or Services. Any references to a Member being "verified" (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification or digital identification process and nothing else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by Pedpo about any Member, including of the Member's identity or background or whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. You should always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to enter a contract, or buy or rent an item/s through market or receive Services through our services section, or use other Services, accept a buying, renting or booking a request from a User, or communicate and interact with other Users, whether online or in person.   
        </p>
        <h3 class="font-semibold text-base md:xl mt-8">Eligibility, Using the Pedpo Platform, Member Verification</h3>

            <br> <br>
            User verification on the Internet is difficult and we do not assume any responsibility for the confirmation of any Member’s identity.

        <br><br>
        The access to or use of certain areas and features of the Pedpo Platform may be subject to separate policies, standards or guidelines, or may require that you accept additional terms and conditions, before you can access the relevant areas or features of the Pedpo Platform. If there is a conflict between these Terms and terms and conditions applicable to a specific area or feature of the Pedpo Platform, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence with respect to your access to or use of that area or feature, unless specified otherwise in the latter terms and conditions.
